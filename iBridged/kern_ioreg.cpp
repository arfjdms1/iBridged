/*
 * How did we get here?
 *
 * The OTA process in macOS has sort of buggered itself for the weird configuration of Hackintosh systems using ASB.
 *
 * The Image4 library, be it `com.apple.security.AppleImage4` (/System/Library/Extensions/AppleImage4.kext) or the userspace
 * library (`libimg4.dylib` or `libimage4.dylib`) has a set of Image4 'chips'
 *
 * These 'chip' structures provide runtime data on the security policy of the Mac, alongside parameters for Image4 decoding.
 *
 * Validation of Image4 files require the parameters to match the device; which is where things get weird on Hackintoshes.
 *
 * As of some unknown version of macOS, Apple has four x86 'chip' types when evaluating non-cryptex Image4 files:
 * - img4_chip_x86_ap (Equivalent to the Full Security setting)
 * - img4_chip_x86_ap_medium (Equivalent to the Medium Security setting)
 * - img4_chip_x86_ap_void (Equivalent to the No Security setting)
 * - img4_chip_x86 (x86legacyap)
 *
 * AppleImage4/libimg4/libimage4 uses the `apple-coprocessor-version` variable to determine which Image4 'chip' to use, defaulting to
 * `img4_chip_x86` when no 
 *
 * When sealing the system volume, patchd uses a root hash encased in an Image4 file, which is ran through the function `img4_firmware_execute`
 * On systems using Apple Secure Boot, this would break the entire OTA process if RestrictEvents' SBVMM was not used.
 *
 * The specific log is as follows:
 * patchd: patchd_store_failure_info(879): setting ota-failure-reason=MSU 1130 (Failed to verify against canonical metadata);NSPOSIXErrorDomain 13 (img4_firmware_execute failed);
 *
 * Thankfully, XNU provides headers for the Image4 library in the EXTERNAL_HEADERS folder.
 *
 * Code 13 is actually a POSIX errno_t code, EACCES, which the header documents this code meaning that 
 * 'The given chip does not specify the constraints of the attached manifest', indicating a mismatch in the Image4 'chip'
 *
 * And thus is why this kext was created.
 *
 * --- ADDENDUM (13/02/2026) ---
 * Somewhere along the line, macOS also uses the iBridge TargetType (jXXXap) to identify the Mac on an update level.
 * Tahoe, Sequoia and maybe earlier will fail on T2 SMBIOSes because it will report the <Model>X,Y value instead of the iBridge model.
 * As a result of directly interfereing with softwareupdated, it also restores updating on T2 SMBIOSes without needing SBVMM too.
 * The outcome is that OTAs can be completed without hassle on systems that don't do executable patching (eg: BlueToolFixup).
 * Since softwareupdated is usually loaded early on, and is the primary source for updating, the chance of a patched dyld page being re-checked for a valid
 * signature is unlikely, so it's a one-size fits all solution, I suppose. So I doubt we'll face crashes from the code signature enforcer crashing anything that uses
 * BridgeOSInstall.framework in OS versions > 14.x, so no AppleSystemInfo.framework type crashes. I'm open to being proven wrong.
 * I... didn't expect this? I guess. It's a win, I suppose.

 *
 * This is only triggered in WhateverGreen if it finds an AMD GPU in the local system, so dGPU-less Intel is unaffected.
 * Same with Intel + NVIDIA, or AMD + NVIDIA, I believe.
 *
 * This is why I didn't find anything wrong in my own system, since I use my GPU without any kexts and since my
 * Dell Optiplex doesn't have a dGPU of any sort.
